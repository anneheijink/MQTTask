ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* build.xml
* custom_rules.xml
* exportjar.xml
* ic_launcher-web.png
* pom.xml
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => org.eclipse.paho.android.service/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => org.eclipse.paho.android.service/src/main/assets/
* res/ => org.eclipse.paho.android.service/src/main/res/
* src/ => org.eclipse.paho.android.service/src/main/java/
* src/org/eclipse/paho/android/service/package.html => org.eclipse.paho.android.service/src/main/resources/org/eclipse/paho/android/service/package.html

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
